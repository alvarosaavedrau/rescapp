This is Rescapp.  Welcome.

This file contains instructions for installing Rescapp.
Rescapp does not need to be compiled.

The Install Requirements
========================

Rescapp depends on some software packages installed into your system. If
you don't have any of them, please obtain and install them before
installing Rescapp.

* GNU Make
* GNU Coreutils


Installing Rescapp
====================

The simplest way to install this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code.

  2. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.


Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/bin', `/usr/local/lib', etc.  You can specify an
installation prefix by preceding `make' with environment variable prefix.

E.g.: prefix=/usr make install

DESTDIR environment variable also works as a prefix as Debian (and other
GNU/Linux distributions expect it to work).

E.g.: DESTDIR=/tmp/rescapp-test prefix=/usr make install

Please note, however, that Rescapp knows where it is located in the
filesystem.  If you have installed it in an unusual location, the
system might not work properly, or at all.  The chief utility of these
options for Rescapp is to allow you to "install" in some alternate
location, and then copy these to the actual root filesystem later.

The Runtime Requirements
========================

Rescapp depends on some software packages installed into your system. If
you don't have any of them, please obtain and install them before
using Rescapp.



chntpw binaries need to be overwritten after their Debian Jessie packages installation (Check The Debian Package Runtime Requirements section )
Here there is a copy-and-paste from Rescatux README documentation:

Till the current bug in sampasswd (it does not save its changes)
and till samunlock is added upstream we need to build this program on our own.

Get chntpw source code from:

* branch : chntpw-ng-1.01
* repository : https://github.com/rescatux/chntpw

You might need to run:

ln -s /usr/include/asm-generic /usr/include/asm

so that the upstream source code builds ok

Then run (inside a Jessie chroot):
make

so that: samunlock, sampasswd, samunlock.static and sampasswd.static are generated.
