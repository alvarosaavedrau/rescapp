<h2> Why non-free?</h2>
Because you have some special hardware in your computer/laptop which doesn't behave correctly with free-as-freedom drivers only.
Some examples might be:
<ul>
<li>Not getting a graphical desktop but a blank screen.</li>
<li>Getting unusable video resolutions.</li>
<li>Wifi not working.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Where do I download non-free version of Rescatux?</h2>
Rescatux does not release a non-free version of Rescatux because of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">ethics</a>.

<h2>But I need help to repair my computer. Please help me!</h2>
Well, you can just use a Debian non-free live cd/usb and install rescapp on top of it.
It's almost as if you had Rescatux but without SELinux support (mostly needed for Fedora/Redhat/CentOS systems).

<h2>Where do I download those non-free Debian live cds?</h2>
<br/>
You can find the latest non-free stable releases for Debian live here:
<a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/">Current non-free live images</a>.
The current Debian version as of 2019 is buster. Rescapp is based on buster and buster will last for about two years.
<br/>

You should aim at the lxqt version, e.g. download <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-10.1.0-amd64-lxqt+nonfree.iso">debian-live-10.1.0-amd64-lxqt+nonfree.iso</a>.
<br/>
You may want to use an older version: <a href="https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/unofficial/non-free/cd-including-firmware/archive/10.0.0-live+nonfree/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-10.0.0-amd64-lxqt+nonfree.iso">debian-live-10.0.0-amd64-lxqt+nonfree.iso</a> if the newest 10.1.0 version features unusable keyboard+mouse in your specific computer model.
<br/>
You can use other graphical live cd versions other than the lxqt one, but be aware that you may have to download more packages.
<br/>

<h2> Rescapp installation on non-free Debian live cds.</h2>
First of all make sure that your non-free Debian live cd has a working internet connection.
<br/>
<b>TIP</b>: At this point you may want to visit this page from your non-free live cd so that it's easier to copy and paste.
<br/>
Then at the menu choose <b>System Tools</b> then <b>Qterminal</b>.
<br/>
Copy and paste this single line in a go and press enter.
<pre>
sudo apt update ; sudo apt install wget ; wget "http://rescatux.sf.net/repo/rescapp-nonfree-install.sh" -O rnfi.sh ; chmod +x rnfi.sh ; sudo ./rnfi.sh
</pre>
Please wait untill all the packages are installed and configured. Once the <i>user@debian:~$</i> prompt is back you can close the Qterminal window.
<br/>
<h2> How do I start repairing my computer ? </h2>
In order to start rescapp, on the menu choose <b>Other</b> then <b>rescapp</b>.
