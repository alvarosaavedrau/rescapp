<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i> based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays a list of partitions, that have on them the following file: <i>/etc/issue</i>. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your main GNU/Linux distribution, (you will probably only see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>

  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>Rescapp backups the old /etc/sudoers file, into a file named /etc/sudoers_YYYY_... and tries to setup a new, /etc/sudoers file that includes, the selected user as the sudo admin.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>You are informed about the, /etc/sudoers file creation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Success! The sudoers file was changed OK! :) or</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! The sudoers file was not changed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>A log file called <i>sudoers.log.txt</i> can be found in the Desktop <i>logs</i> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>Once you are able to gain, admin privileges on your system, you are advised to check, if your sudoers file is correct, depending on your distribution, via the visudo command.
  </li>
</ul>
