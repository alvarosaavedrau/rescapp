<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for all the partitions based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file. If the partition contains an: <i>/etc/issue</i> file it will also obtain the distribution name.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>Rescapp displays a list of the partitions found on Step 1.<p></p>You are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose whatever partition you want to force the filesystem check on and press the OK button.<p></p>Explanation of description is:
    <ul>
      <li>
	<b>Distribution name</b>: Your distribution root partition has been detected and you are seeing its name.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Not detected</b>: The partition can be mounted but there is not an <i>/etc/issue</i> file on it. It is probably a non root partition.
      </li>
      <li>
	<b>Cannot_mount:</b>: The partition cannot be mounted. Maybe it is the partition you want to fix, another one that Rescatux cannot mount, or maybe a SWAP partition.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>You are informed about the fsck process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p>
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
  <IMG SRC="../not-documented/images/dialog-ok-apply.png">
  [SUCCESS] Filesystem check with automatic fix was OK! :)

  or
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
  <IMG SRC="../not-documented/images/dialog-error.png">
  [ERROR] Filesystem check with automatic fix failed! :(
  </b>
  </p>
  </div>
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>A log file called <i>fsck.log.txt</i> is generated so that you can share it later if needed.
