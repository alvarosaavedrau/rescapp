<p></p>
TIP: To start using Rescapp right know press the <b>Menu</b> button on the top.
<p></p>
This is Rescapp. The main Rescatux UI.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_001_full_window.png"><p></p>
We are going to take a tour, through its options. The first thing you should know, is that you can always go back, to the first Rescapp screen, thanks to the <b>Menu</b> button.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_002_main_menu.png"><p></p>
If you happen to need help, it is good to know, that on the top part, of the UI the <b>Support options</b> are located.<p></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Chat</b>: Opens the Hexchat window, so that can you ask for help, on the Rescatux IRC channel.</li>
  <li><b>Share log</b>: Generates a pastebin file, from an existing log file, so that you can ask for help, in the chat window, with your data at hand.</li>
  <li><b>Help</b>: Opens the help you are currently reading just in case you're not sure of something</li>
</ul>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_003_support_options.png"><p></p>
Below the main menu and support options, you will find the <b>categories</b>. Categories serve as tags for classifying all of the Rescapp options.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_004_categories.png"><p></p>
You may want to focus on the <b>Boot</b> category.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_005_boot_options.png"><p></p>
Once there you can see the <b>Easy GNU/Linux Boot Fix</b> option. Clicking on it will show its information on the bottom embedded web-browser, but it will not run it.
<p></p>
If you want to run it you will have to click on <b>Run !</b> button.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_006_grubeasy_selected.png"><p></p>
You have to know that options inside the <b>Expert Tools</b> category are not supported by the Rescatux team. Those options launch their associated programs so that it's easier for you to use them. Expert in this context means that an equivalent Rescapp option would be considerably easier to use. Some of those tools might be usable by non expert users after all.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_007_expert_tools.png"><p></p>
Other tools might be found thanks to the Start menu. Once again these tools are not supported by the Rescatux team.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_008_start_menu_tools.png"><p></p>
Finally we will learn, how to shutdown Rescatux. The powerdown button, is found in the bottom right corner.(I inside O).
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_009_powerdown1.png"><p></p>
You will then be prompted, what you want to do. Either you will select Shutdown, to turn off your computer, or reboot to use it immediately.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_010_powerdown2.png"><p></p>
Finally you are asked, to remove the media (cd/dvd or usb), from your computer and press ENTER to continue, so that the computer can be shutdown or rebooted.
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/help-rescapp_011_powerdown3.png"><p></p>
TIP: If you wait for two minutes after pressing either the shutdown or reboot buttons and that specific text does not show and the computer does not turn off or reboot then please remove the media (cd/dvd or usb), from your computer and press ENTER.
<p></p>
TIP: To start using Rescapp right know press the <b>Menu</b> button on the top.
