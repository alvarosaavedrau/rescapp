<a name="english">Restore GRUB on the MBR - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<p>
If you have an old system based on MBR boot (non UEFI) you might find that a Windows reinstallation hides your GNU/Linux distribution.<br/>
You are not longer able to boot into your GNU/Linux distribution because the Grub menu is no longer there.<br/>
This option lets you reinstall your GNU/Linux distribution grub into your MBR again so that your Grub menu appears again.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for GNU/Linux partitions.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays them. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which GNU/Linux partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your main GNU/Linux distribution, (you will probably only see one) and press the OK button.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard disks present, on your system based on information found in the <i>/proc/partitions</i> file.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard drive do you wish to install Grub on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to, take a look at the hard drive sizes, (to be able to identify your hard drives) and choose (usually) the one, that is set to be the first one, to boot in your BIOS or UEFI settings.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p></p>(NOTE: This step is automatically skipped if your system only has one hard disk.) <p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Order hard drives, according to boot order. Press OK to continue.</i><p></p>. Take a look at the hard drives and their sizes. Order them according, to the BIOS boot order and then press OK.
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/grub-install_003_order_hard_disk.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to create a temporary device.map on your Linux installation, (which will be deleted later) and try to install grub on your selected hard drive, thanks to your own distribution's grub-install command.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the grub installation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p>
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
  <IMG SRC="../not-documented/images/dialog-ok-apply.png">
  [SUCCESS] Grub was installed OK! :)
  </b>
  </p>
  </div>
  or
  <div style="padding: 5px; border: 6px solid green; margin: 7px;">
  <p>
  <b>
