<a name="english">Recompute CHS on a hybrid MBR on a GPT partition - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<br/>
<br/>
TIP: You probably do not need to use this option in 2020.
<br/>
<br/>
This option can sometimes help if a disk utility, OS, or BIOS doesn't like the CHS values used by the partitions on the protective or hybrid MBR. In particular, the GPT specification requires a CHS value of 0xFFFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, but this value is technically illegal by the usual standards. Some BIOSes hang if they encounter this value. This option will recompute a more normal CHS value -- 0xFEFFFF for over-8GiB partitions, enabling these BIOSes to boot.

<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives on your computer.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such hard drives have been found, Rescapp displays a list of the hard drives. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which hard drive do you wish to recompute its hybrid MBR CHS on?</i>
  <p></p>
  You are supposed to choose, the hard disk which, has a GPT partition for which, you want its hybrid MBR CHS to be recomputed.

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to recompute the CHS, for the hybrid MBR on your GPT hard drive.

  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are informed about the hybrid mbr CHS recompute process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p>
