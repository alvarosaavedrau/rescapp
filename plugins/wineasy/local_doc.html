<a name="english">Easy Windows (promote, reset and unlock) - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<p>
In addition to resetting the password (described below) this option also unlocks an account and promotes it so that it becomes a Windows administrator.
</p>
<h3>Problems that are usually solved</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Scenario 1: <b>You forget Windows password</b></p>
Whatever the reason is you have forgotten your Windows password. When you try to login into Windows with your previous password or trying with a blank password it denies your login.
</li>
<li><p>Scenario 2: <b>Your former sysadmin disappears</b></p>
Your former sysadmin is no longer there. It doesn't matter if you have fired him and he's angry at you or if he had a fatal car accident. You need to take in control of your Business Windows server.
</ul>
<h3>When not to use this option:</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><b>About encrypted Home directories</b></p>
If you want to recover data from the account you are clearing its password and this account is encrypted this is not the method for you. Find another way to crack the original password. If you insist using this option you might lose access to the account data forever.
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Locked or expired account</b></p>
If the account you are trying to clear its password has been blocked or it's expired you will need to find a way to un-block or un-expire it. Well, you can always use this method and finally figure out that it was blocked.
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Network access only</b></p>
If you have your computer in a datacenter and you don't have a direct access to it (Screen, keyboard and mouse directly or via a KVM) then RDP won't let you login into the system with the cleared password account. You need another method that let's you define a new password instead of just clearing it.
</li>

<li>
<p><b>Microsoft account</b></p>
If the account you are trying to clear its password is a Microsoft account (online account) this option will not work for you.
</li>

</ul>

<h3>What do you get after using the option?</h3>
If everything goes ok the next time you boot your computer when Windows login appears you will either be logged in automatically or you will need to select your cleared password account. Just pressing RETURN (I mean that you don't need to write any password) will log in into the system.
<p>
Additionally the account will be promoted to an administrador role and it will also be unlocked (if the user was locked).
</p>
