<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for, primary partitions on your drive.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays a list of the partitions. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your Windows partition, (you will probably only see one), and press the OK button. If you have several versions of Windows, the best version of Windows to choose, is the first one that you installed on your computer.

  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard drive, do you wish to install the Windows mbr on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to, take a look at the hard drive sizes, (to be able to identify your hard drives), and choose (usually), the one that is set, to be the first one to boot, in your BIOS settings.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to set up a Windows mbr, on your chosen hard drive, so that the partition you have chosen, is booted at startup.<b>Please wait</b>. Currently with, (Rescatux 0.23), this step is time consuming, but no Please wait message has been implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the mbr, installation process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p><i>Success! The Windows mbr was installed OK! :) or</i><p></p>or<p></p><i>Failure! The Windows mbr was not installed. Something went wrong! :(</i>
  </li>
