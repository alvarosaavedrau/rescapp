<a name="english">Restore generic MBR code so that Windows boots again - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<p>
Newest computers start up thanks to the newest (from 2015 onwards) UEFI boot system.
</p>
<p>
Older computers start up thanks to the old BIOS boot system.
</p>
<p>
This option is aimed at older computers starting up thanks to the old BIOS boot system (or new systems where the CSM (Compatibility Support Module) is turned on).
</p>
<p>
One common scenario is having your GNU/Linux distribution installed alongside Microsoft Windows. You decide to get rid of your GNU/Linux distribution and you remove its partition. Unfortunately in your next boot you get:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>grub rescue></b>
</li>
or
<li>
<b>grub></b>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
and whatever you try you are unable to boot either into GNU/Linux (that's correct because you have removed the GNU/Linux partition) or to boot into Windows.
</p>
<p>
This option lets you install a generic MBR code so that you can directly boot into Windows bypassing the grub remainings from your old GNU/Linux distribution.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for, primary partitions on your drive.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays a list of the partitions. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which Windows partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your Windows partition, (you will probably only see one), and press the OK button. If you have several versions of Windows, the best version of Windows to choose, is the first one that you installed on your computer.
  </li>

  <li>
  <b>Step 3</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for hard drives present, on your system.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 4</b><p></p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>Which hard drive, do you wish to install the Windows mbr on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to, take a look at the hard drive sizes, (to be able to identify your hard drives), and choose (usually), the one that is set, to be the first one to boot, in your UEFI/BIOS settings.
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/winmbr_002_hard_disk.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 5</b><p>(NOTE: This step is automatically skipped if your system only has one hard disk.)</p>You are prompted:<p></p><i>What is the correct position, for this hard drive?</i><p></p> Just select the right boot order position, for the prompted hard drive, according to your BIOS settings.
  </li>
<p></p><IMG SRC="images/winmbr_003_position_hard_disk.png"><p></p>
  <li>
  <b>Step 6</b><p></p>Rescapp with all the gathered information, is going to set up a Windows mbr, on your chosen hard drive, so that the partition you have chosen, is booted at startup.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 7</b><p></p>You are informed about the Restore generic MBR code so that Windows boots again process.<p></p>You either get:<p></p>
