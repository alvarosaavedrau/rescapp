<a name="english">Check if there is a bios_grub partition on a GPT disk - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<br/>
<br/>

When a computer is booted in BIOS mode (either because its the only boot mode or because you force legacy boot mode in an UEFI system) grub-pc package is used. The grub-efi package is not used.
<br/><br/>
If you pretend to install grub-pc package grub into a MBR disk you probably won't have any problem.
However if you pretend to install grub-pc package grub into a GPT disk you need to make sure to have a bios_grub partition.
<br/><br/>
This option lets you check if a given hard disk in your system has the bios_grub partition or not.
<br/><br/>
If you think that you need to create a bios_grub partition please ask on your distribution usual support places. An option to help you to create a bios_grub partition is not on the short term Rescapp TODO list.
<br/><br/>
TIP: If you have a recent PC (from 2015 or more recent) stop trying to install your Operating Systems in BIOS mode/Legacy mode and use UEFI mode instead.

  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such hard drives have been found, Rescapp displays a list of the hard drives. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which hard drive do you want to check for a bios_grub partition on?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose the hard drive which has a GPT partition for which you want its bios_grub partition to be checked.
