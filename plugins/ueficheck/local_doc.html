<a name="english">Check if Rescatux has boot in UEFI mode - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<p>
There are two main ways of booting a computer nowadays. The old BIOS boot way and the newest (from 2015 onwards) UEFI boot way.
</p>
<p>
If your main system boots in UEFI boot mode you are advised to boot Rescatux in UEFI boot mode so that the UEFI boot recover options work ok.
</p>
<p>
If your main system boots in BIOS boot mode it doesn't matter too much in which boot mode you boot Rescatux.
</p>
<p>
This option shows you if you have booted in UEFI boot mode or if you have not booted in UEFI boot mode (that means you have booted in BIOS boot mode).
