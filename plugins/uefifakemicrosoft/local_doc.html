<a name="english">Fake Microsoft Windows UEFI boot entry - Rescapp - Documentation</a>
<p>
Newest computers start up thanks to the newest (from 2015 onwards) UEFI boot system.
</p>
<p>
Some of the UEFI firmware vendors do not comply with UEFI specifications but enforce their own UEFI boot menu algorithm. One of the most abused algorithms is only allowing UEFI entries which are the specific Microsoft Windows entries. That means that the boot entry label must be <b>Windows Boot Manager</b> and sometimes it's even enforced only one of those two paths: EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgr.efi and EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi.
</p>
<p>
So one scenario is someone trying to install a GNU/Linux distribution alongside Windows. <b>Despite of the UEFI entries being properly installed into the UEFI firmware somehow the UEFI firmware insists in booting only into Windows.</b>
This option lets you install your GNU/Linux UEFI boot entries as if there were Windows entries so that you can finally boot by default into your GNU/Linux distribution.
</p>
<p>
Please note that in some UEFI systems you might need to press an special hotkey (such as F8 or F10) in order to show up the UEFI boot menu in order to be able to choose your added UEFI boot entry.
</p>
<p>
Please note that if you have Windows entries they will be overwritten. However Rescapp backups them before overwritting them.
</p>
<p>
<b>TIP</b>: You can recover the Windows entries later thanks to the Reinstall Microsoft Windows UEFI boot entries.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <b>Step 1</b><p></p>Rescapp searches for EFI partitions on your system.
  </li>
  <li>
  <b>Step 2</b><p></p>If such partitions have been found, Rescapp displays them. At the same time you are prompted:<p></p>
  <i>Which EFI System partition?</i><p></p> You are supposed to choose, your EFI System partition and press the OK button.
